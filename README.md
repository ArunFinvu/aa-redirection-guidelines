# Introduction

The AA Webview integration endpoint enables seamless integration of FIU application with AA to provide a frictionless user experience.

The AA Webview can be invoked by redirecting the FIU page to the Webview URL as an HTTP GET request along with some URL parameters, or using any other mechanism that would allow interaction between FIU and AA on the userâ€™s device.
